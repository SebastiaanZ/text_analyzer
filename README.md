# Word Frequency Analyzer
_Analyze the frequency of words in a piece of text._

**Note:** This is a programming assignment and not suited for general usage.

- [Getting Started](#getting-started)

## Installation

The package itself has no external dependencies and runs with Python 3.9+. To run the application, simply download the package from this repository and import `word_frequency_analyzer` into your application. Optionally, you can install the package using `pip`: Run `python -m pip install .` with directory containing `setup.py` as the working directory.

### Linting & Testing Dependencies

To run the test suite and `flake8` with similar configurations as I'm using, a number of additional dependencies are required:

#### Testing dependencies
```
coverage
hypothesis
```

#### Linting Dependencies
```
flake8
flake8-annotations
flake8-bugbear
flake8-docstrings
flake8-import-order
flake8-polyfill
flake8-string-format
flake8-tidy-imports
flake8-todo
pep8-naming
```

To make installing these dependencies easier, both a `requirements.txt` and `Pipfile` (requries `pipenv`) are provided to install them.

```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt  # install from requirements.txt
python -m pipenv sync --dev  # Install from Pipfile.lock
```

To test the package, including a coverage report generated by coverage.py, run:
```
python -m coverage run -m unittest
python -m coverage report -m  # the `-m` asks to list missed branches
```
## Getting Started

To get started, simply import the main class, `WordFrequencyAnalyzer`, into your own code and analyze a text!

```py
from word_frequency_analyzer import WordFrequencyAnalyzer

with open(path_to_text, "r") as f:
    text = f.read()

analyzer = WordFrequencyAnalyzer(text)

print("The highest word frequency in the text is:", analyzer.calculate_highest_frequency())
print("The word 'hello' appears", analyzer.calculate_frequency_for_word("hello"), "times in the text")

print("The three most common words in the text are:")
for word_frequency in analyzer.calculate_most_frequent_n_words(3):
    print(f"{word_frequency.word}: {word_frequency.frequency} times")
```

## Reference

The package provides a single general usage class, `WordFrequencyAnalyzer`, that you can use to analyze the word frequencies in a string.

### class `word_frequency_analyzer.WordFrequencyAnalyzer(text: str)`
A class to analyze a piece of text.

#### Parameters
`text: str`  
_The original text analyzed._

#### Attributes
`text: str`  
_The original text analyzed._  

`word_frequencies: collections.Counter`  
_A mapping of words to their frequencies in the text (case-insensitive)._  

#### Methods
`calculate_highest_frequency() -> int`  
_Calculate the highest word frequency and return it._  

`calculate_frequency_for_word(word: str) -> int`  
_Calculate the frequency for the given word._  

`calculate_most_frequent_n_words(n: int) -> list[WordFrequency]`   
_Calculate the list of `n` most common words. The list is primarily ordered by frequency and secondarily ordered alphabatically._  

### class `word_frequency_analyzer.WordFrequency(word: str, frequency: int)`
A class to represent a combination of a word with its frequency. This class is typically not instantiated directly.

#### Parameters
`word: str`  
_The word._

`frequency: int`  
_The frequency of the word._

#### Attributes
`word: str`  
_The word._

`frequency: int`  
_The frequency of the word._
