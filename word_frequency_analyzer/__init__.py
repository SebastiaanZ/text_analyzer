"""
WordFrequencyAnalyzer analyzes word frequencies in a text.

Words are defined as sequences of characters in the set `[a-zA-Z]` and
separated by all characters not part of that set. This package comes
with two implementation styles:

- A modern idiomatic implementing
- An alternative Java-esque implementation using staticmethods

To use the alternative implementation, use `alternative.WordFrequencyAnalyzer`.
