"""
A Java-esque implementation of the WordFrequencyAnalyzer.

This is an alternative implementation of the assignment tha more
closely follows the specified interface/class API. However, this
leads to patterns that are fairly uncommon or even generally
considered to be anti-patterns in modern Python applications.

The main difference with the specification here is that, in Python,
"getter"-methods are typically implemented using properties. This
means that there are no `get_word` or `get_frequency` methods in the
WordFrequency class, but rather properties that serve the same purpose
but follow the "uniform access principle" (as defined by Betrand Meyer
in "Object-Oriented Software Construction", 1988, 1997).
